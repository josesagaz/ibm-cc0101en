1
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:10,828
Hybrid cloud, as we covered in the previous lesson,

2
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:15,427
is a computing environment that connects an organization's on-premise

3
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:20,245
private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single infrastructure for

4
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:23,098
running the organization's applications.

5
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:27,432
Multi-cloud is a cloud adoption strategy that embraces a mix of cloud

6
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:31,621
models from different service providers, public, private, and

7
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:36,490
managed, across infrastructure, platform, or software services.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,368
For example, a business may consume email as a service from one provider,

9
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:46,838
a CRM application from another, and infrastructure from yet another provider.

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,930
So essentially,

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,952
a hybrid multi-cloud implies you are able to leverage the best of cloud models and

12
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:57,687
services across different service providers and have your applications and

13
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:01,870
workloads working seamlessly across multiple different clouds.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,112
In this video, we will look at some use cases for

15
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:10,470
why a business may want to use a hybrid multi-cloud approach.

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,753
>> In this video, I want to touch on a few of those use cases for

17
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:17,154
why a business may want to to use hybrid or multi-cloud.

18
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:20,710
Let's start with the basic one, cloud scaling.

19
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,908
Now, most of us are probably familiar with this.

20
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:27,980
It's one of the main reasons for adopting the cloud.

21
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,673
Now let's say we have a flower delivery service that is able to hit a certain

22
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,246
bottom line of users.

23
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:41,338
They have on premise infrastructure and it can hit a certain amount of user load.

24
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:43,124
So visualizing this here.

25
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:48,649
Throughout a calendar year, you can imagine that their load maybe goes up and

26
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:51,818
down and responds to specific holidays.

27
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:56,876
Now, to hit those peaks, they could scale up their on premise architecture,

28
00:01:56,876 --> 00:02:00,622
but that's met with upfront costs and costs of upkeep.

29
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:05,022
Now instead, what they'll instead do is take advantage of cloud

30
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:08,702
that allows them to scale up in response to that load and

31
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:13,900
then automatically deprovision resources when they no longer need them.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,980
Now, this concept is kind of general to cloud computing, not just hybrid or

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,998
multi-cloud.

34
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,374
But that brings me to my next topic, and

35
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:26,211
here we're going to be talking about how it can be used to build a composite cloud.

36
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:34,029
So essentially this is going to be applications that are spread across

37
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,346
multiple cloud environments.

38
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:38,852
So back to the flower delivery service.

39
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:43,049
Let's say they have on premise architecture that allows them to run three

40
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,016
major components of their app.

41
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:50,129
So let's say they have the Web UI, they have some

42
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,138
billing APIs, as well as a rewards framework.

43
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:03,268
Now let's say that this service is actually based in EU and

44
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:06,156
their European customers are happy.

45
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:10,664
But for their North American or American customers, specifically around

46
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:15,872
Veterans Day or Thanksgiving, they're noticing that the system is bogging down.

47
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:21,265
And so they decide to take advantage of a hybrid cloud or multi-cloud architecture

48
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:26,074
by composing their application across multiple cloud environments.

49
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:30,546
So, they'll take advantage of data centers in America and essentially they've

50
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:34,499
identified that although the rewards framework can stay on prem in their

51
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:38,760
European side, they want to move the billing and the UI capabilities over.

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,189
So, they'll move just those two to a cloud platform of

53
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:48,108
their choice in a North American or American data center.

54
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:52,261
This kind of allows them to scale up portions in response to, say,

55
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:57,058
American holidays while keeping their EU portions individually scaled.

56
00:03:57,058 --> 00:04:01,685
So in this example, the flower delivery service is able to take advantage of

57
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:07,230
scaling at a global level by using the hybrid or multi-cloud architecture.

58
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,330
Next, let's talk about the airline or travel industry.

59
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,102
So we can first start with an example of modernization.

60
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:22,794
Now, in the past we've seen that reservation systems may have been

61
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:25,924
difficult to work with or you might have had to call in.

62
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:30,230
But almost all all the airline companies now have a mobile application.

63
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,846
So most of the time, and we've actually found that it's about,

64
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:36,476
in general not just in the travel industry, but

65
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,354
80% of all enterprise applications are actually still on prem.

66
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,924
And that's likely the case in this industry as well.

67
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:47,522
So in this specific example, let's say they have a reservation system that's

68
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:51,503
running on prem, but to create new experiences for their end users,

69
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:55,470
let's say they've created a mobile application.

70
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,432
That mobile app, of course, has a mobile backend that's maybe running in

71
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:05,076
a public cloud and that in turn works with the reservation service.

72
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,436
So, again, the mobile app can hit the mobile backend and

73
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:11,914
that in turn works with the reservation capabilities.

74
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:16,710
So in this case they've modernized and new user experiences are possible.

75
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,798
But let's take that a step further.

76
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:21,060
Now, a source for a lot of dissatisfaction for

77
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,438
users is whenever their flights are delayed.

78
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:26,702
So when a flight is delayed, they may have to rebook new flights.

79
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,860
The solution is almost always the same.

80
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,530
The traveler wants to get to his destination in the easiest way possible.

81
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,216
So what airline industries have been doing is taking advantage

82
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:40,910
of the cloud to create maybe a recommendation feature.

83
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,922
So, it allows them to book new flights as soon as a delay is recommended or

84
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:48,150
as soon as a delay is incurred.

85
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,522
And that's going to connect up to that mobile back end service, allowing users to

86
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:56,810
be able to book flights through their phone the second a flight is delayed.

87
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,126
This not only improves the bottom line for the airline industry, but

88
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,434
leads to happier users.

89
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,870
So that's one way the modernization has been done.

90
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,450
Next, let's take it even a step further and talk about data and AI.

91
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,155
For data and AI,

92
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:18,636
the airline industry has been taking advantage of lots of historical data.

93
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:22,504
So over the decades that a company has been around, let's say they

94
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:28,170
have historical data of when unplanned maintenance has happened on their airline.

95
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,539
In fact, 30% of all delay time in the airline industry is actually when

96
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,768
unplanned maintenance happens.

97
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:38,608
So by taking advantage of, let's say, machine learning or

98
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:43,501
AI capabilities, they could hook into all of the legacy data that they have,

99
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:48,770
large volumes and connect them up to machine learning and AI capabilities.

100
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,379
This allows airline industries to take advantage of predictive analytics and

101
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:58,094
get insights before errors or before the unplanned maintenance ever occurs.

102
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,671
This again improves their bottom line,

103
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:05,510
leading to happier users and a more efficient airline industry.

104
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,241
Now, today we talked about four major use cases for hybrid and

105
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,904
multi-cloud platforms.

106
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:15,868
So cloud scaling and composite cloud in the flower delivery service as well

107
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,506
as modernize and data and AI for the airline industry.

108
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:24,542
>> Another reason for adopting hybrid multi-cloud strategy is to prevent lock-in

109
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:29,344
to a specific vendor's cloud platform and having flexibility of being

110
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:34,392
able to move work loads from one cloud platform to another as the need arises.

111
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:39,556
In the next video, we will understand what a microservices architecture is,

112
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:42,386
its features, benefits, and use cases.
