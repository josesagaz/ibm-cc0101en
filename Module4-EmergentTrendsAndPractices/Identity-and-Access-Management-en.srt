00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,920
According to the Cloud Security Report by Cybersecurity Insiders,

1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,120
the top cloud security concern of cybersecurity professionals

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,530
is data loss and leakage.

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,300
Unauthorized access through misuse of employee credentials

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,410
and improper access controls

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,720
is the single biggest perceived vulnerability to cloud security,

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,020
followed by insecure interfaces and APIs.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,360
In this video, we will look at how Identity and Access Management,

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,020
also known as access control, works as the first line of defense,

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,470
allowing you to authenticate and authorize users

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:52,780
and provide user-specific access to cloud resources, services, and applications.

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,620
A comprehensive security strategy needs to encompass the security needs of a wide audience

12
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,170
—including organizational users, internet and social-based users,

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,020
third-party business partner organizations and vendors.

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,140
There are three main types of users:

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,010
Administrative Users, Developer Users, and Application Users.

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:23,470
Administrative users include cloud platform administrators, operators, and managers:

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,020
—roles that typically create, update, and delete application and service instances,

18
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,470
and also need insight into their team members’ activities.

19
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,860
An attacker on an administrative account

20
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,660
can steal data from production database service instances,

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,290
deploy malicious applications inside the customer's domain,

22
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,950
or even deface or destroy existing applications.

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,120
Developer users include cloud application developers,

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,710
platform developers, and application publishers.

25
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,460
Developer users are authorized to read sensitive information

26
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,600
and to create, update, and delete applications.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,940
The third type of user is the Application user.

28
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,540
These are the users of the cloud-hosted applications.

29
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,760
Let’s look at the key components of identity and access management, and how they work.

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,530
Authentication, or the identity service,

31
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,610
enables applications deployed to the cloud to authenticate users at an application level,

32
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,750
based on a range of identity providers such as the cloud directory,

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,860
social identity providers such as Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter,

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,850
enterprise-hosted identity provider, and cloud-hosted identity provider.

35
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,190
Sometimes API keys, or unique identifiers

36
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,880
are passed into an API to identify the calling application or user.

37
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,230
Multifactor authentication is used to combat identity theft

38
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,840
by adding an additional layer of authentication for application users,

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,590
such as single-use passwords or pins, certificates, tokens,

40
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,980
risk-based authentication, (such as changes in the user’s location,

41
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,520
past activity, and preferences.)

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,370
Cloud Directory services are used to securely manage user profiles

43
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,590
and their associated credentials and password policy inside a cloud environment.

44
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,820
A directory service within a cloud means that applications hosted on the cloud

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,260
do not need to use their own user repository.

46
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,180
Reporting helps provide a user-centric view of access to resources

47
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,960
or a resource-centric view of access by users.

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,530
Reports typically give information about which users have access to which resources,

49
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,300
which users have changes in access rights,

50
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,950
which access is being exploited by each user, and under which conditions.

51
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,550
Audit and compliance

52
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,860
is a critical service within identity and access management framework,

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,420
both for cloud provider, and cloud consumer.

54
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,620
Auditors use these processes to validate implemented controls

55
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,160
against an organization's security policy, industry compliance,

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,300
and risk policies--and to report deviations.

57
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,400
User and service access management capability enables cloud application and service owners

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,650
to provision and de-provision customer, partner, and vendor user profiles

59
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,930
with minimal human interaction.

60
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,980
This streamlines access control based on the role, organization, and access policies

61
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,160
defined by the owner.

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,980
User accounts of administrators and developers give access to sensitive information.

63
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,780
In order to mitigate the risks of these accounts being hacked into,

64
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,770
you require maximum control over the whole life cycle of these users.

65
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,200
Some of the controls that can help secure these sensitive accounts include:

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,250
provisioning users by specifying roles on resources for each user;

67
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,180
password policies that control the usage of special characters,

68
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,320
minimum password lengths and other similar settings;

69
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,640
multifactor authentication like time-based one-time passwords;

70
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,770
and immediate de-provisioning of access when users leave or change roles.

71
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,300
Cloud providers offer Identity Access and Management services,

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,670
typically including the ability to create access groups,

73
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,100
add users to access groups, and manage access for existing users.

74
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,950
An access group is a group of users and service IDs

75
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,650
created so that the same access can be assigned to all entities within the group

76
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,490
with one or more access policies.

77
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,620
Access policies define how users, service IDs, and access groups in the account

78
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,630
are given permission to access account resources.

79
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:07,090
Policies include: a subject, which can be users, service IDs, or access groups;

80
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,690
a target, which is the resource or provisioned service offering,

81
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,290
to which you want to provide access;

82
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,300
and role, which defines the actions allowed on the target of the policy,

83
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,380
that is, the resource to which the access is being granted.

84
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,530
Access groups provide a more streamlined access assignment process

85
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,220
as compared to assigning individual access to each user

86
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,940
and help reduce the number of policies in an account.

87
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,180
In this video, we learned how Identity and Access Management

88
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,860
work as the first line of defense to secure the cloud.
