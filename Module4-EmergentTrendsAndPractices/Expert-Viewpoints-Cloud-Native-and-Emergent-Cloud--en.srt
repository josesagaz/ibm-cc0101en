00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,530
Welcome to Cloud Computing: Emerging Trends and Technologies - Expert Viewpoints.

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,810
in this video, we will listen to several cloud application professionals

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,250
discuss trends and technologies in cloud computing.

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,220
>> The top three trends that I see coming in the next couple of years

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,820
are as follows.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,460
First, is this idea of a hybrid cloud,

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,570
as IBM has predicted, a lot of companies and clients will move

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,180
from a single cloud provider to multiple cloud providers.

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,710
That could be multiple public clouds or a public cloud and on-premise private cloud.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,600
Second, I see this big surge of edge computing

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,520
becoming more prominent in cloud computing.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,860
Now the terms may seem quite different from each other and disjointed, but

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,520
in many sense the cloud computing will go on the edge.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,460
The numbers state that quite overwhelmingly,

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,790
there are 75 billion devices that are supposed to come up online by 2075.

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,920
And the edge computing,

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,740
in order to be able to communicate between devices and back to the server,

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,190
is going to be very crucial.

19
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,570
And lastly, it's the usage of machine learning and artificial intelligence

20
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,040
to make decisions for us in the cloud computing space.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,180
So, these are my top three trends that I see coming in the next couple of years.

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,660
>> So one of the emerging trends in cloud computing is serverless

23
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,020
and that's the area of cloud computing where,

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,190
all you need to do is give the cloud your application logic.

25
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,660
And that means you don't need to patch any servers,

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:06,110
you don't need to manage the high availability of your infrastructure,

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,650
you don't have to put in multiple availability zones.

28
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:17,370
The cloud provider takes care of all of those operational issues for you

29
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,930
and all you do is give it the code and it runs it on demand.

30
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,200
So, every time you have an event triggered,

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,900
let's say it's a voice assistant, and every time you talk to it,

32
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,710
it triggers a cloud function-- that is what serverless is.

33
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,750
And so, developers love it because with serverless,

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,780
you don't need to do all the undifferentiated work,

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,180
the work that does not make your app unique.

36
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,470
You can focus on the logic that makes your app unique.

37
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,360
>> So in terms of emerging technologies, one of the big ones is cloud native,

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,100
cloud native architecture.

39
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,870
And that includes the trend towards microservices,

40
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,690
basically dividing up monolithic applications,

41
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:18,270
what would have been monolithic legacy applications into granular microservices.

42
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,560
And this affords a whole range of advantages.

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,610
Another one is containers and container orchestration systems and most notably,

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,630
the Docker and Kubernetes technologies.

45
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,530
Another is serverless services, where

46
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,400
some functional code can be spun up with very low latency

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,390
without the need to manage any virtual servers.

48
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,690
And the term cloud native architecture really

49
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,040
encompasses some combination of all of these,

50
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,730
in terms of emerging trends...

51
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,970
>> So I'd like to discuss a couple trends I see all the time in cloud computing right now.

52
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,860
First of all, we have serverless computing, and that's the idea that

53
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,830
you don't have to worry about anything

54
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,520
other than writing the code for your application.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,730
You don't need to know "are you deploying Kubernetes?"

56
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,520
"Do you need to know IP addresses?" "Is this Linux?" Nothing.

57
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,110
and I really see this as the future because

58
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,010
you don't want to have to worry about how it's deployed,

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,080
managing RAM, managing CPU, any of that stuff;

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,590
you just want to create code.

61
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,650
And the easier that it is to get your code from written to deployed and running well,

62
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,690
the better, and it's a win for everybody.

63
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,220
>> Another area that's emerging in cloud technology is DevOps

64
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:48,190
and with DevOps, you have the developers a lot more integrated with operations.

65
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:55,700
So you've got a CICD pipeline where the developers can push their own code and

66
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,490
see it live on the servers or the serverless functions.

67
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:10,020
And DevOps is a term that has a lot of different definitions.

68
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,920
One definition I've enjoyed hearing is

69
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,060
that it means the developers are talking with operations and vice versa,

70
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,800
that there's a dialogue going on.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,320
And it's not just how it was in the past where the developers hand over the code,

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:34,170
but the developers really see the lifecycle through to it being maintained in production.

73
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,840
>> In terms of emerging trends,

74
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,830
we're seeing comprehensive cloud services for building data pipelines,

75
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,270
data science in general, and artificial intelligence services.

76
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,620
And specifically,

77
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:57,630
we're seeing low-level AI services to build AI solutions from the ground up,

78
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,490
along with higher level pre-trained AI solutions

79
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:11,250
for things like image recognition, speech applications, just to name a few.

80
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:19,150
Another whole area of advancement is in the area of cybersecurity,

81
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:27,250
it's obvious that cybersecurity is something that we have to be constantly aware of

82
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,200
and improving all the time.

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,810
And we're seeing a constant stream of improvements to secure

84
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,970
your network perimeter, compute resources, and data in the cloud.

85
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:45,250
>> Another emerging trend in cloud computing is application modernization.

86
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,720
So, with cloud providers coming out with

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,470
all these amazing services that do a lot of things for you,

88
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,600
the companies are thinking, "Wait a second,

89
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,620
the cloud provider is doing certain features of our application better than we are."

90
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,510
"And instead of continuing to maintain that part of our application ourselves,

91
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:16,070
let's rewrite the application to take advantage of these cloud native services."

92
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:23,180
For example, there are services now that do transcription or image recognition.

93
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,330
And rather than, have your own...

94
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,890
inference and training servers that you manage, and

95
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,180
use open source machine learning models that you host,

96
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,040
and you train those models on data that you give it--

97
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,900
Don't do any of that!

98
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,990
Just drop the images in an...

99
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,400
image recognition service of a cloud provider,

100
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,290
and you're not managing any service-- you just get the data.

101
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,590
