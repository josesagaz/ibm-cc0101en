1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,180
Many organizations have huge investments in existing applications

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,380
that are often siloed in legacy systems

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,320
and are very difficult and expensive to update and maintain.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,530
Modernizing these applications can unlock great benefits for these organizations

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,540
such as accelerating their digital transformations,

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,800
enabling them to take advantage of new technologies and services,

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,270
and becoming more responsive to their customers' needs

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,800
and changing market dynamics.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,830
Cloud computing is one of the three main ingredients in Application Modernization.

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,080
In the rest of this video we will see how,

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,980
and what else Application Modernization entails.

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:59,530
Hi, I'm Eric Minick, with IBM Cloud, and I want to talk about application modernization

13
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,650
and three huge transformations that have been going on together.

14
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,340
We've got three things going on, they're interrelated,

15
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,580
and this is what we're seeing, this change in how we're doing architecture, infrastructure,

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,260
and our ways of working - how we deliver.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,770
And if we go back in time a little bit, we saw applications that were very monolithic,

18
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,390
they were running on physical servers and we used waterfall style development

19
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,370
where we'd have long plans and we'd say okay, this is gonna be our planning phase,

20
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:42,290
our development phase, our testing phase, and we could plan out a year as a project.

21
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,680
And that's really what we've gone away from.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,030
So if we look at how most organizations are working today,

23
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,180
architecturally, they've got some sort of distributed architecture.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,570
It's usually related to a service-oriented architecture;

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,000
the big buzzwords a few years ago,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,820
but some sort of distributed architecture: we have a bunch of web services,

27
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,420
they're talking to each other, we've got some databases on the back end,

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,830
and then some front ends that kind of go through all that.

29
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,350
On an infrastructure level, they're running on some sort of a virtual machine, alright?

30
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,850
So, we said:

31
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,440
we could probably do better than having to order a new server every time we have a new service.

32
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,800
Let's virtualize this stuff, and we need a little more density along the way.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,400
And from a way of working; you know, Agile development, pretty normal--

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,140
and then trying to figure out a little bit of what happens downstream.

35
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:54,210
So this takes us up to where a lot of teams are today, but not really where they're going.

36
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,930
And so if we look at that next phase.

37
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,220
We're taking another pass at this service-oriented architecture,

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,190
and really shrinking the sizes of the services,

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,000
taking advantage of the more dynamic infrastructure we have.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,630
And we're calling these now microservices, right?

41
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,850
Microservices.

42
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:27,040
So we've got a microservice architecture, so very small, very focused services,

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,150
moving away from a lot of the heavyweight XML-based communication we saw in SOA,

44
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,890
towards more REST-based communication, things like that.

45
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,620
But same idea, let's keep breaking into smaller and smaller pieces.

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,000
We have more independence of what we ship.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,280
More rigor in saying this service needs to be independent from another service,

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,270
so I can change these things by themselves.

49
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:59,260
On the infrastructure side: Cloud.

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,740
Cloud's pretty popular.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,610
And this could be public cloud, this could also be private cloud.

52
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,930
I'm painting with a very broad brush when I say cloud here.

53
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:18,720
And then from a delivery, in a way of working: we could say that DevOps is really key.

54
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,860
And I would include in this, approaches like site reliability engineering, SRE.

55
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,280
More the ways of working we have today.

56
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,990
Now that that's fine and interesting.

57
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,550
But what do these things have to do with each other?

58
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,120
I'd argue that what we're really seeing is modernization in

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,810
in how the applications are delivered, and how they're built--and what they are.

60
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,380
And while you could walk into any large enterprise today

61
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,780
and you'll find someone who says "We are going through a cloud transformation."

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,240
You'll often find someone who says, "Yes, I'm in charge of leading the DevOps transformation."

63
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,830
You'll walk into enterprise architecture, they'll say, "Yes, we are pushing microservice architectures."

64
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,450
Individuals think that they're going through three separate transformations.

65
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,030
But they're really tied.

66
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,940
Right?

67
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,520
If I'm doing microservices, and I have new microservices all the time.

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,230
And in order to get a new microservice up and running,

69
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,640
I'm over here, and I have to order a new physical server,

70
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,910
and then rack and stack it a couple months later.

71
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,230
I'm not gonna get any time-to-market benefits.

72
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,520
The resilience benefits that I'm gonna normally look for

73
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,480
from microservices are gonna be modest, at best.

74
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,540
Microservices want cloud infrastructure. You want to be able to say,

75
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,590
I've got a new microservice; let me put it in a container and

76
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,160
just run that container right now and scale that dynamically.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,530
Similarly, cloud really likes running microservices.

78
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,970
The benefits of being able to dynamically scale

79
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,220
are really cool when you have a lot of small things that you might need a few of or a lot of.

80
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,070
It's not as interesting when I've got a monolith that isn't even distributed. How do I scale that?

81
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,920
I get a bigger cloud server?

82
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:31,650
And then all of this is kind of, baking in this idea of speed and resiliency,

83
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,720
and DevOps brings that together.

84
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,900
The developers who have always wanted speed,

85
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,320
the operations people who've always wanted that resiliency.

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,840
They're going to be programming that cloud. Right?

87
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,210
The programmable infrastructure that cloud provides

88
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,360
needs operations people who understand resiliency--

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,820
but bring some of that development skill in.

90
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,540
And to really take advantage of these new infrastructures, the new architectures,

91
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,740
you need these new ways of working.

92
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,010
And you also are gonna say, "if this is going to give me time-to-market benefits,

93
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:19,220
I can't be back here, and say 'Yeah, we've got a one-year project plan that we're just gonna execute.'"

94
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:25,180
I need to be able to be more agile, and adapt in my planning and my responsiveness to the business.

95
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:33,460
I need to better wire up my applications so they can be more easily monitored and more resilient.

96
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,580
We have to have the application in a way that,

97
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,120
it knows when one of these services is failing, and we can spin up another.

98
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:51,520
So this is really, for me, fascinating, that you walk into these organizations everywhere,

99
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,040
and they're undergoing these three different transformations.

100
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,220
But they're always doing them together.

101
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,940
And when they don't - it doesn't quite work.

102
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,840
So you've got these three transformations going on at once.

103
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,820
And you'll hear us talk a lot about application modernization.

104
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,580
See it written across the top here?

105
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,530
When I think of application modernization, I think it's just this.

106
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,970
It's this transformation right here;

107
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,970
going from these kind of monoliths, or service-oriented architectures,

108
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,330
to microservices;

109
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,850
adopting Cloud;

110
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,130
modernizing our ways of working towards DevOps and SRE.

111
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,710
That's AppMod.

112
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,370
It's a really exciting time.

113
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,730
And it's really great when you're able to go after it in a holistic fashion.
