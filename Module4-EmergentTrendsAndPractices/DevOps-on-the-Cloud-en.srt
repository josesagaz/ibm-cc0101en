1
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,108
Development teams need to design, develop, deliver, and

2
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:16,340
run software as reliably and efficiently as possible.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,124
Operations teams need to identify and resolve problems as soon as possible by

4
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:26,604
monitoring, predicting failure, managing the environment, and fixing issues.

5
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:30,983
Combining development and operations with the ability to monitor and

6
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:34,257
analyze and optimize bottlenecks gives us DevOps.

7
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:39,336
A collaborative approach where business owners, and the development, operations,

8
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:43,974
and quality assurance teams collaborate to continuously deliver software.

9
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:48,957
A DevOps approach applies agile and lean thinking principles to all stakeholders

10
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:53,578
in an organization who develop, operate, or benefit from the business's

11
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:57,898
software systems, including customers, suppliers, partners.

12
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:02,862
By extending lean principles across the software supply chain, DevOps capabilities

13
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,014
improve productivity through accelerated customer feedback cycles.

14
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:11,190
Unified measurements and collaboration across an enterprise, and

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,286
reduced overhead, duplication, and rework.

16
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:19,668
Using the DevOps approach, developers can produce software in short iterations

17
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:24,981
on a continuous delivery schedule of new features and bug fixes in rapid cycles.

18
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,719
And businesses can seize market opportunities and

19
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,152
reduce time to include customer feedback in their products.

20
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:36,442
The DevOps process involves continuous delivery, which is about delivering small,

21
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:40,964
well-designed, high quality increments of software to customers.

22
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:42,597
Continuous integration,

23
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:47,215
creating packaged builds of the code changes released as immutable images.

24
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:50,914
Where immutable implies that when modifications are needed,

25
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:54,481
the entire component is replaced with an upgraded version.

26
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:58,875
Continuous deployment, which involves progressing each new packaged build

27
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,360
through the deployment lifecycle as rapidly as possible.

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,233
Continuous monitoring with tools that help developers understand the performance and

29
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:11,851
availability of their applications even before they are deployed to production.

30
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:17,360
Delivery pipeline, which is an automated sequence of steps that involves the stages

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,252
of ideation, coding, building, deploying, managing, and continuous improvement,

32
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:27,574
which loops back to the ideation phase in the delivery pipeline.

33
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:33,054
While DevOps can apply to applications anywhere, there is especially a compelling

34
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:38,008
case for DevOps when it comes to cloud ready and cloud native applications.

35
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:43,104
With its near limitless compute power and available data and application services,

36
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:47,422
cloud computing platforms come with their own risks and challenges.

37
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:52,064
DevOps tools, practices, and processes are helping tackle some of

38
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:55,746
the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud and

39
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:59,906
allowing solutions to be delivered quickly and reliably.

40
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:04,362
Let's look at some core capabilities that DevOps provides to help building and

41
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:07,730
running applications in the cloud a lot more manageable.

42
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,596
DevOps best practices make it possible to programmatically provision servers,

43
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:15,492
build middleware, install application code,

44
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:20,349
and fully automate the installation process in a way that is documented,

45
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,341
repeatable, verifiable, and traceable.

46
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:27,274
Application deployments often involve considerable complexity.

47
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,281
The DevOps practices of continuous integration and

48
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,724
continuous deployment help create a fully automated deployment pipeline,

49
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:39,102
which is important all through the application development lifecycle.

50
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:43,819
Cloud native applications form a complex distributed system with multiple

51
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,274
moving parts, independent tech stacks, and rapid release cycles.

52
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:53,509
DevOps principles are essential to define how people work together to build,

53
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:57,858
deploy, and manage applications in a cloud native approach.

54
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:01,489
With the DevOps best practices of automated provisioning and

55
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,610
continuous deployment, developers, quality professionals, and

56
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,429
other stakeholders can test in low cost production-like test environments that

57
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:15,188
were previously not available, enhancing both productivity and quality.

58
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:20,698
When systems are compromised or struggling to recover from natural disasters, DevOps

59
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:25,930
best practices make it possible to rebuild these systems quickly and reliably.

60
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,060
DevOps provides a powerful set of principles, practices, and

61
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,879
tools to realize the full potential of cloud native computing as well as for

62
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,178
modernizing existing applications to leverage cloud benefits.
