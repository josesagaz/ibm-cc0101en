00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:11,247
Given the concerns around data security and privacy,

2
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:15,742
especially in public cloud environments, encryption plays a key role and

3
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:20,323
is often referred to as the last line of defense in a layered security model.

4
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:24,931
This protection not only encrypts data, but also provides robust data

5
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,250
access control, key management, and certificate management.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,926
In this video, we will take a closer look at cloud encryption.

7
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:37,693
Encryption is defined as scrambling data in a way that makes it illegible.

8
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:41,679
There are two parts to an encryption system, the encryption algorithm and

9
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,828
the decryption key.

10
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:47,885
The encryption algorithm defines the rules by which data will be transformed so

11
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:49,704
that it becomes illegible.

12
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:54,617
And the decryption key defines how the encrypted data will be transformed back

13
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:55,742
to legible data.

14
00:00:55,742 --> 00:01:00,774
Encryption ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and

15
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:05,660
when accessed or intercepted without authorization, data is unreadable and

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,634
meaningless.

17
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:10,400
Cloud providers offer various cloud encryption services,

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,196
this could be limited encryption of data that is identified as sensitive, or

19
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:18,985
end-to-end encryption of all data uploaded to the cloud.

20
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:21,284
Data is encrypted upon receipt, and

21
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:25,892
encryption keys are passed to the customers to decrypt data when needed.

22
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,726
Keys need to be managed securely.

23
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:31,844
If you lose your keys, you will not be able to read your data.

24
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:37,788
Data needs protection in three states: at rest, in transit, and when it is in use.

25
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:42,902
Encryption at rest protects data while it is physically stored in a database or

26
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,221
the storage layer.

27
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:48,724
Depending on the application and business requirements, there could be multiple

28
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:53,353
options for encrypting data at rest, such as encryption for block and file storage,

29
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:57,810
built-in encryption, in object storage, and database encryption services.

30
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,806
Encryption in transit protects data while it is transmitted from one location

31
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:03,643
to another.

32
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:08,128
Encryption in transit includes encrypting the data before transmission,

33
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,833
authenticating endpoints, and decrypting and verifying data on arrival.

34
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:17,140
Secure Sockets Layer or SSL and Transport Layer Security,

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,544
TLS are commonly used protocols for encryption in transit.

36
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:25,268
They are not only used when accessing websites securely,

37
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:29,905
but also for data moving between servers and services within the cloud.

38
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:34,966
Encryption in use protects data when it is in use in memory for computations.

39
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:37,584
It allows computations to be performed on

40
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:40,960
encrypted text without needing to decrypt the data.

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,545
Cloud storage encryption could be server-side or client-side.

42
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:50,396
Server-side encryption occurs after Cloud storage receives your data, but

43
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:53,272
before the data is written to disk and stored.

44
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:57,880
For server-side encryption you can either create and manage your own encryption

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,150
keys, known as customer supplied encryption keys, or you can generate and

46
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,624
manage your encryption keys using key management services offered by the cloud

47
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,322
storage provider, known as customer managed encryption keys.

48
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:15,202
Client-side encryption occurs before data is sent to Cloud storage.

49
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:18,172
This way, users can utilize encryption keys and

50
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:21,577
algorithms that are not visible to the cloud provider,

51
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:26,305
making it virtually impossible for cloud providers to decrypt hosted data.

52
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:31,222
Given that a majority of enterprises today operate in multi-cloud environments,

53
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:34,961
there is a need to implement a singular data protection strategy

54
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:39,617
across an enterprise on-premise, hybrid, and multi-cloud deployments.

55
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:44,324
Some cloud providers offer multi-cloud data encryption services with a range of

56
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:48,823
features, such as data access management, integrated key management, and

57
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:52,916
sophisticated encryption that combine to deliver the scalability and

58
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:57,690
flexibility to help protect the most sensitive workloads across the enterprise,

59
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,970
regardless of where the data resides.

60
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,397
Using a multi-cloud data encryption console, you can define and

61
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:09,376
manage access policies, create, rotate, and manage encryption keys,

62
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,289
and aggregate access logs.

63
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:16,113
Encryption does not eliminate data security risk, it separates the security

64
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:20,366
risk from the data itself by moving security to the encryption keys.

65
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,476
These keys need to be managed and

66
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:26,471
protected against threats in order to keep the data secure.

67
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:31,179
Key management services offered by some cloud providers help perform lifecycle

68
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,079
management for

69
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,008
encryption keys that are used in cloud services or customer-built applications.

70
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:40,867
They enable customers to encrypt sensitive data at rest and

71
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:45,806
to easily create and manage the entire lifecycle of cryptographic keys that

72
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:47,514
are used to encrypt data.

73
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:50,484
Since the keys remain in possession of the customer,

74
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:54,910
the data is protected from cloud service providers as well as from other users.

75
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,333
Some of the best practices for encryption key management include:

76
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,609
Storing encryption keys separately from the encrypted data.

77
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:07,226
Taking key backups off site and auditing them regularly.

78
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:09,117
Refreshing the keys periodically.

79
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:14,199
Implementing multi-factor authentication for both the master and recovery keys.
