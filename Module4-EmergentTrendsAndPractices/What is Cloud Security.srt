Welcome to What is Cloud Security Part 2.

1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,590
Organizations are migrating their workload to a hybrid cloud environment increasing the

2
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,100
threat attack surface.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,500
This expansion can result in new data security and compliance challenges.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,869
Thus, you require a robust data-centric cybersecurity program to protect your data.

5
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,960
In addition, you require centralized visibility and monitoring against unauthorized access,

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,810
exposure, or data theft across your enterprise data environment.

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:42,020
Let’s discuss some data security capabilities that you can implement to protect your data.

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,450
To secure data, you can improve maturity across people, process, and technology.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,750
Identify your most critical data assets, who has access to them, and how they are protected.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:58,340
You can prevent data loss by detecting, preventing, and enforcing policy violations to avoid accidental

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,370
data loss.

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,230
Implement data security governance by establishing process, metrics, and continuous steady-state

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,970
data discovery and classification.

14
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,710
In addition, it is critical to monitor database security by enforcing data protection and

15
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,630
compliance policies across hybrid cloud environments.

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,070
Your next focus in a cloud environment should be the management of access controls and authentication.

17
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,520
You need to develop Cloud identity and access management (IAM) strategies that provide and

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,500
work on zero trust architecture, risk protection, and constantly authenticate any user to any

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,510
resource.

20
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,340
An organization should consider the following points while building the IBM cloud:

21
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,840
Modernize at your own pace, matching your business requirements.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,170
Retain your existing investments and on-premises applications, while slowly inducting the right

23
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,049
cloud IAM architecture to complement or replace your framework.

24
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,619
Establish a zero-trust implementation that will provide a centralized access control,

25
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:06,009
preserve client confidentiality, reduce insider threats, and secure your remote resources.

26
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,459
Zero trust model and plan use an environment that securely connects the right users to

27
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,050
the right data at the right time under the right conditions, while also protecting your

28
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,000
organization from cyber threats.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,340
Enable scalability for your cloud IAM for millions of users or transactions without

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,750
a major modification of the infrastructure.

31
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,500
Another element of cloud security is cloud network security which refers to the security

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,380
measures, technology, policies, controls, and processes used to protect data on public,

33
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,860
private, and hybrid cloud networks.

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,420
There are many security implications when you extend your network to a cloud environment.

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,970
To meet modern network security requirements, organizations need to deploy and manage network

36
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,590
security built directly on the cloud.

37
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,560
The benefits of cloud network security are: Centralized security monitoring and management

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,200
Easy management and updating of granular policies Real-time detection and powerful prevention

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,950
against intrusions, DDoS, and other web-based attacks

40
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,860
Automated configuration and management, helping to eliminate misconfiguration errors, and

41
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,640
maintain control over traffic Encryption services to protect data at rest

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,470
and in transit Centralized protection and management of identity

43
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,530
and access Let’s summarize the best practices you can

44
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,590
follow for cloud security.

45
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,330
There are some critical steps under three phases that you can follow.

46
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,940
First is identifying your cloud usage state and risks.

47
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,840
Second is protecting your cloud system, and third is responding to attacks.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,260
The first phase comprises: Identifying how your data is accessed

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,110
Detecting unknown cloud usage Checking your configurations for cloud services

50
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,840
Monitoring for signs of malicious usage of cloud data

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,950
In the second phase, you can protect your cloud system by:

52
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,950
Assigning protection policies Encrypting sensitive data

53
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,670
Formulating policies for data sharing Restricting data sharing to unknown devices

54
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,040
Implementing a bot protection and mitigation solution

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,940
Using a proper anti-malware solution The third phase offers best practices for

56
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,540
responding to attacks and attempts to attack: Add additional authentication and verification

57
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,590
steps for high-risk access scenarios Add new policies for new cloud services

58
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,450
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has made a list of best practices and

59
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,669
principles that establish a secure and sustainable cloud computing framework.

60
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:44,440
These principles are NIST's five pillars of a cybersecurity framework: Identify, Protect,

61
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,010
Detect, Respond, and Recover.

62
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,759
Another emerging technology in cloud security that supports cybersecurity framework is cloud

63
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,639
security posture management (CSPM).

64
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,229
CSPM solutions are designed to address a common error in many cloud environments, that is,

65
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,560
misconfigurations.

66
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,480
CPSM also addresses issues by helping in the deployment of the core components of cloud

67
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,180
security.

68
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,720
They include identity and access management (IAM), regulatory compliance management, traffic

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,169
monitoring, threat response, risk mitigation, and digital asset management.

70
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,400
The colossal increase in cloud adoption across the cyberworld will motivate cybercriminals

71
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,620
to target organizations in the cloud environment.

72
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,920
Although organizations are taking adequate security measures, they are still vulnerable

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,020
to cyber-attacks.

74
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,360
The current major trend in cloud security includes multi-cloud strategies such as cybersecurity

75
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,960
mesh, zero-trust security models, hybrid and multi-cloud environment, cloud-native tools

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,650
and applications, deployment of DevSecOps, securing remote workforces, and AI and machine

77
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,919
learning for threat detection.

78
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,719
The focus is on privacy and data protection regulations.
